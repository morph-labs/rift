# Rift

At [Morph](https://morph.so), we believe that:
- Future software will be mostly written by AI, and augmented/supervised by humans.
- Keeping personal data safe and computations secure will become increasingly important.
- The future of software belongs to everyone.

That is why we are releasing Rift, an [open-source language server](./rift-engine) and [IDE extension](./editors/rift-vscode) that lets everyone deploy a personal AI software engineer â€” locally hosted, private, secure, open-source, and free.

## The road ahead
Existing code generation tooling is presently mostly code-agnostic, operating at the level of tokens in / tokens out of code LMs. The [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) defines a standard for *language servers*, objects which index a codebase and provide structure- and runtime-aware interfaces to external development tools like IDEs.

The Rift Code Engine is an AI-native language server which will expose interfaces for code transformations and code understanding in a uniform, model- and language-agnostic way --- e.g. `rift.summarize_callsites` or `rift.launch_ai_swe_async` should work on a Python codebase with [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/blog/starcoder) as well as it works on a Rust codebase using [CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen). Within the language server, models will have full programatic access to language-specific tooling like compilers, unit and integration test frameworks, and static analyzers to produce correct code with minimal user intervention. We will develop UX idioms as needed to support this functionality in the Rift IDE extensions.

## Getting started
Install the VSCode extension from the VSCode Marketplace or by building and installing from the VSIX bundle produced by `vsce package ./editors/rift-vscode/`.

Run the Rift server by following the instructions in the [readme](./rift-engine/README.md).
